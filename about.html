    <h1>About me :)</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Alexia Aldea, first-year student at the University of Bucharest, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science and I'm studying Computer
        Science at the moment. This site is a gallery of my paintings during a year and a half. Beside my passion for computer programming,
        art is also my passion.</p>
    <p>I hope you'll enjoy seeing my work and you'll find your inspiration too!</p>
